It currently uses local mongoDB for storage.

## Setup and Requirements

Install MongoDB community edition on your local machine.

Run to install all of the required packages:
```
$ npm install 
```
 It is currently setup to use port 3001, you can change this if needed in the server.js file.

To run NodeMon: `$ npm run devStart`

## Possible improvements
I would like to add MongoDB atlast as an online storage instaed of the local storage.
